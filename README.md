# brochure
This is a practice coding, when I was starting to learn HTML, CSS, JS. I made this to familiarize and improve my skills in styling and in html.
This is a brochure that I got when I was walking inside the mall. After I got home I tried to put it in the web to try and practice my skills.
After several days I completed it and it is also responsive.
